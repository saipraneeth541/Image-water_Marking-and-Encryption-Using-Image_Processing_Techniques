# Image-water_Marking-and-Encryption-Using-Image_Processing_Techniques

The Rubik's Cube Algorithm is used for encrypting images after applying watermarking. We will employ separate techniques for watermarking. To ensure privacy of the content within the image, we will utilize hybrid techniques. After applying the watermark to the image, we will proceed to encrypt it. Our main objective in this project is to achieve privacy, while maintaining the integrity of the image during transmission over public networks.
